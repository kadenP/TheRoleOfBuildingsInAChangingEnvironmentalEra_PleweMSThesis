# The Role of Buildings in a Changing Environmental Era (Plewe MS Thesis)
Scripts and data used in the analysis for my MS Thesis: The Role of Buildings in a Changing Environmental Era, A Modeling Approach to Quantifying and Reducing Emissions

Material for Chapter 2 can be found at the repository for PECT (https://github.com/SSESLab/electricityandenvironment.git) and referenced using the following citation: 

Plewe, K. & Smith, A. D. PECT: A tool for computing the temporal and spatial variation of externalities related to power generation in the United States. SoftwareX 9, 61â€“67 (2019). doi:10.1016/j.softx.2018.12.001

Materials for Chapter 3 include the MATLAB script that was used to model the small office building and to simulate the various control schemes that were presented in the tesis. Along with the MATLAB script, the data used for describing the building model are included.

Materials for Chapter 4 include all of the Python scripts that were used for the uncertainty analysis, sensativity analysis and the optimization procedure. There are many dependencies that are required to run these scripts, all of which are described in the thesis.
